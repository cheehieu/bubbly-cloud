## Overview
I've had a fascination with bubbles for quite some time now. Especially the large bigger-than-a-person sized ones. I purchased a cheap bubble machine on Amazon.com to bring my shopping cart total to $35 for free shipping. After receiving (and playing with) the bubble machine, I wanted to make it "smart"-er. Thus began the onslaught of ideas from making it WiFi-connected to be controlled with a mobile phone, to 3D printing custom bubble-wands, to increasing the rate of bubble output, to mounting the connected machine on an autonomous quad-copter.

## Hardware
For prototyping, I began with an MSP430-WiFi solution and some spare hobby motors. I also found some 25mm 5DC fans used in a past project. A friend of mine recently bought his own 3D printer, so I went to designing custom wands of different shapes and sizes.

The Funrise Gazillion Bubble Machine can be purchased from [Amazon](http://amzn.com/B00OZECKFK) for $14.99 with free shipping.

## Software
I tested the MSP430 software offering of Energia and CodeComposer Studio using the motor control and WiFi libraries. 

## Bubble Output
The Gazillion bubble machine has the capability to output 500 bubbles per minute (bbpm). I didn't count each individual bubble, but the bubbly-cloud seems to have an output of ___ bbpm.
